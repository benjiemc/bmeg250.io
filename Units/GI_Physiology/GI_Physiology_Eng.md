# Endoscopy

> __Learning Objectives__
> * Describe endoscope: structure, technique, application

## Overview
* Inserted into organs for examination
* Advantage: less invasive then open surgery
* Disadvantage: limited viewing area

## Flexible Endoscope
![Endoscope](Figures/flexible%20endoscope.png)

* Upper GI endoscopy
  * Gastroscopy - stomach
* Laryngoscopy - vocal chords
* Bronchoscopy - lungs
* Esophagoscopy - esophagus
* Hysteroscopy - uterus

<br>

* Flexible tube equipped with lenses and a light source
* Fibre optic endoscope: optical viewing bundles
* Video endoscope: microchip camera at insertion tube

### Control Section
![control](Figures/control%20section.png)
* Angulation control knobs
  * direct up/down and left/right deflection of the tip
  * Air/water and suction valves
  * Remote video switches
  * Entry port to the instrument channels
* Fibre optic have an eye piece as well
  
### Insertion Tube
![insertion tube](Figures/Insertion%20tube.png)

* For easy insertion, must be able to translate subtle movements
* Design criteria:  
  * 1:1 transfer ration of movement
  * Torquing bands facilitated by flat, spiral metal bands

#### Distal End
* One or two instrument channels
* one or two light guide bundles (incoherent fiber optic)
* an air channel, a water channel
* Either image guide bundle or camera
* Angulation wires

#### Insertion Section
* Biopsy forceps
* Graspers
* Baskets
* Injectors
* Dilators
* Knives

### Bending Section
* Detachable portion - different construction from rest of tube
* Angulation wires control direction of curl

### Optical Fiber 
* **Total Internal Reflection**: All light is kept in medium, no refraction
  * Occurs at a critical angle
* Snell's Law
  
  $\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{\sin{\theta_2}}{\sin{\theta_1}}$

* Long, thin strand of pure glass, diameter of human hair
* arranged in bundles, **optical cables**
  * coated with glass of lower optical density to prevent leakage
  * Responsible for fine meshes that can appear in fibre optic images
* Coherent bundles
  * images
  * parallel fibres
  * transmit in phase images
  * more fibres (~10,000) means better resolution
* Non Coherent Bundle
  * Light bundles
  * resolution not important
  * Xenon arc (300 W)
  * halogen-filled tungsten filament lamps (150 W)

## Surgical/Rigid Endoscope
* Laparoscopy
* Arthroscopy
* Urology
* Gynecology

## Capsule Endoscope
* PillCam
* no sedation
* good for GI investigation
* less than 4 mg
* Disadvantage: Expensive, non reusable, impossible to control camera
* Future scope: zooming nad auto focusing, reduction in size, cost effective
